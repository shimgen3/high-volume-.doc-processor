# high-volume-.doc-processor
This code is used to copy the content of many .doc or .docx files and transform the format of footer and header. It was a program I created for a company that changed business partners or something similar, and needed to delete and replace their logo with their own, as well as update the address within the many datasheets for each of their files. We managed to transform 600 datasheets, a task that manually could have taken weeks or months.
This code might have multiple errors because I'm not very experienced in programming yet, and for reasons I'm not aware of, the 'compytes' library sometimes encounters errors with different applications. The code requires a base file named 'destination.docx' for the format, which can be edited according to the desired format.
